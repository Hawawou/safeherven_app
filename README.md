## Introduction 

Our motivation is the desire to provide a place where victims of gender-based violence can air out their minds in all safety and without being judged considering the fact that some victims do not have anyone in whom they can confide. Also, a lot of victims do not know where they can get the necessary help so we have provided a list of organisations whose goals are to help victims.


## Key Features
A friendly chat bot if you just need someone to talk to or want to know the next steps or what to do if faced with any of those mentioned issues.

A map with common places you'll most likely need to go to and with just one tap, you find the closest place to you.

A curated list of non-governmental organisations, foundations and frontline workers with their details. These NGOs are out to help such people but sometimes they don't even know where to go to and which is legit
